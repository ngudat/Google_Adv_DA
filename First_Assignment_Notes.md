I hope you are adjusting well in your new position.

We are so happy to have you. We have been growing quickly, and we really could use your expertise. 

For your first task on the team, you’ll be diving right into our current contract with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The TLC has been collecting New York City- based data on taxi and rideshare trips for several years now. They've contracted our team to build a regression model that predicts ride durations based on distance, time of day, season, and additional variables as we find necessary.

For your first task, please draft a plan of action for the team. Include questions we need to answer before we get started on the project, important details to consider at the beginning of the project, and action items we'll need throughout the duration of the project. 

I understand you’ve completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate and learned the skills for planning, analyzing, constructing, and executing strategies for data science. Jesse did one of the Google Career Certificates, too, and some of these skills have been really useful here at Automatidata. Maybe you could use some things you learned in that program to help  you get started? 

I really appreciate this, and again, welcome to the team!
